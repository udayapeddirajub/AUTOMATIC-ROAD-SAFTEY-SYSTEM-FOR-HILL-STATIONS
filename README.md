# AUTOMATIC ROAD SAFTEY SYSTEM FOR HILL STATIONS
In this repository, I have designed this algorithm to extract the licence plate number from the vehicle image with the OCR technique, you can customize the code as per your requirements. make sure that you have all the required libraries in the mentioned path. 

In hilly regions, the roadway is one of the most often-used modes of 
transport. In these regions, Accident rate and death rates are 
increasing day by day. The roads in this region will definitely have 
bends and steep curves; hence, it is required to maintain a 
particular speed limit and continuous observation. The proposed 
the system is based on image processing technology, The system 
can be mainly used to monitor road traffic activities such as the 
identification of vehicles during traffic violations like speed limit 
violation and to warn the vehicle driver to be in the speed limit at the 
initial entrance of the road, further violations can be traced and this 
information is forwarded to the concerned authority to take further 
effective action, so that we can have a smooth traffic flow and also 
we can avoid accidents occurring in these areas due to 
unconsciousness of the drivers. The foremost focus of the 
the proposed system is to prevent accidents in order to decrease the 
death rates in these regions. This system also provides a way for 
analyzing the number of uphill and downhill vehicles on the hill 
stations by recording the entering and leaving vehicles data at the 
entrance of hill stations.
